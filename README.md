# Search engine

This project is our solution to the second task of the course *AI and the Web* offered by the University of Osnabr√ºck's Cognitive Science program. It is a simple search engine.

## Usage

```shell
# crawl "https://vm009.rz.uos.de/crawl/" and 
# add its contents to the index
$ python crawler.py

# launch flask app locally
$ flask --app app.py run
```
